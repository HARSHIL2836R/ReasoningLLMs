# Enhancing Reasoning Path Diversity in Commonsense Question Answering
## Dataset Name: CommonsenseQA (CSQA)
## Dataset : https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/commonsenseqa
## Paper Title: Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models
## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171v4)
## [Code](https://github.com/codelion/optillm/blob/main/optillm/self_consistency.py)
Input: Data, pretrained LM (like BERT, T5)
Output: Comparison of the self-consistency method with greedy decoding and other baseline methods (e.g., beam search) to highlight its advantages.  
### Note:
Provide metrics like the number of unique reasoning paths, path similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity), and diversity scores (e.g., Shannon entropy) to assess the diversity of generated reasoning paths.
